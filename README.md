**Jellyfisher** is an R package for visualizing tumor evolution and subclonal
compositions using Jellyfish plots. The package is based on the
[Jellyfish](https://github.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish) visualization tool,
bringing its functionality to R users. Jellyfisher supports both
[ClonEvol](https://github.com/hdng/clonevol) results and plain data frames,
making it compatible with various tools and workflows.

![Jellyfisher Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish/refs/heads/main/docs/example.svg)

The package is still under development and the API may change in the future.
Stay tuned!

## Installation

```R
# Install Devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install Jellyfisher
devtools::install_github("HautaniemiLab/jellyfisher")
```

## Usage

Jellyfisher is designed to work with data frames or ClonEvol results.

### Plotting Data Frames

The input data should follow specific structures for _samples_, _phylogeny_, and
subclonal _compositions_, which are described in the [Jellyfish
documentation](https://github.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish?tab=readme-ov-file#input-data).

#### Example

```R
library(jellyfisher)

# Plot the bundled example data
jellyfisher(samples = samples.example,
            phylogeny = phylogeny.example,
            compositions = compositions.example)
```

### Plotting ClonEvol Results

Jellyfisher provides a straightforward way to visualize
[ClonEvol](https://github.com/hdng/clonevol) results using the
`jellyfisher_clonevol` function. The function takes the ClonEvol results as
input and generates a Jellyfish plot.

#### Example

```R
library(clonevol)
library(jellyfisher)

# Run ClonEvol. Check the ClonEvol documentation for details.
y <- infer.clonal.models(...)

# Plot the results
jellyfisher_clonevol(y, model = 1, explicit_parents = list())
```

#### Extracting Data Frames from ClonEvol Results

If you need to process ClonEvol output further or plot it in different ways,
Jellyfisher includes a helper function to extract the relevant data frames:

```R
extract_tables_from_clonevol(y, model = 1, explicit_parents = list())
```

The function returns a list of data frames that you can pass to the
`jellyfisher` function. N.B., ClonEvol reports clonal prevalences as confidence
intervals. The function extracts the mean values and uses them as the prevalence
values.

#### Setting Parent-Child Relationships of Samples

By default, all samples that have no explicit parent are children of the
_inferred root_ sample. To define custom parent-child relationships, you can
pass a list of explicit relationships to the `explicit_parents` argument.

For example, if you have three samples, A, B, and C, they will have the
following relationships by default:

```
    Root
   / | \
  A  B  C
```

With the explicit parents, you can customize the relationships:

```R
explicit_parents = list(
  # The parent of C is B
  C = "B"
)
```

```
    Root
   /  \
  A    B
        \
         C
```

You can alternatively define the relationships by mutating the `samples` data
frame generated by `extract_tables_from_clonevol` before plotting.

## Contributing

_Jellyfisher_ is a thin wrapper for the
[Jellyfish](https://github.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish) visualization tool.
Jellyfish is included as a git submodule in the
[`prepare/jellyfish/`](prepare/jellyfish) directory.

To build the Jellyfish JavaScript dependency, run the
[`update-and-build.sh`](prepare/update-and-build.sh) script in the
[`prepare/`](prepare/) directory. Most of the R code is autogenerated from the
Jellyfish JavaScript code using the
[`generate-R-code.mjs`](prepare/generate-R-code.mjs) script, which should be run
after building the Jellyfish dependency.
