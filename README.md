# Jellyfisher: Visualizing Tumor Evolution with Jellyfish Plots in R

**Jellyfisher** is an R package that wraps the
[Jellyfish](https://github.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish) visualization tool,
bringing its functionality to R users. Jellyfisher uses **htmlwidgets** to
generate interactive Jellyfish plots within R, allowing for the visualization of
tumor phylogeny and subclonal compositions. These plots integrate both
phylogenetic and sample tree structures in a single visualization.

With **Jellyfisher**, you can easily create publication-ready visualizations
based on your data, simplifying the exploration of tumor evolution directly in
R.

## Installation

## Usage

Input data format is the same as for Jellyfish itself. Consult the [Jellyfish
documentation](https://github.com/HautaniemiLab/jellyfish?tab=readme-ov-file#input-data)
for more information.
