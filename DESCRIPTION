Description:
    Generates interactive Jellyfish plots to visualize spatiotemporal tumor
    evolution by integrating sample and phylogenetic trees into a unified plot.
    This approach provides an intuitive way to analyze tumor heterogeneity and
    evolution over time and across anatomical locations. The Jellyfish plot
    visualization design was first introduced by Lahtinen, Lavikka, et al.
    (2023, <doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2023.04.017>).
    This package also supports visualizing ClonEvol results, a tool developed
    by Dang, et al. (2017, <doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx517>), for analyzing clonal
    evolution from multi-sample sequencing data. The 'clonevol' package is not
    available on CRAN but can be installed from its GitHub
    repository (<https://github.com/hdng/clonevol>).
